# mRALE Mastermind Challenge - Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of our model for the mRALE Mastermind Challenge, which focuses on predicting COVID severity on portable chest radiographs (CXRs).

## Challenge Summary
The mRALE Mastermind Challenge aimed to develop an AI/machine learning model capable of predicting COVID severity based on portable chest radiographs. The participants were provided with a dataset of CXRs and tasked with training a model that could accurately classify the severity of COVID in these images.
